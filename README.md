# Hi, I’m Saniru

I’m focused on building **backend systems** and tooling that deals with real-world constraints like concurrency, validation, and infrastructure boundaries.

I’m especially interested in:
- Backend domain modeling
- Distributed systems concerns (locks, queues, idempotency)
- Infrastructure-aware application design
- Clear separation of responsibility between systems

---

## What I’m Working On

### VPN Management Platform
A backend system for safely provisioning and revoking OpenVPN clients.

**Key themes**
- Laravel backend design
- Redis-backed locks and caching
- Asynchronous job execution
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Docker + Docker Compose–based containerisation

This project is published as a **stable snapshot**

---

### Roster Management System
A manual monthly roster and shift scheduling system with constraint-based validation.

**Key themes**
- Explicit domain modeling
- Read-only validation engine
- Bulk APIs for optimistic UIs
- Clear backend/frontend responsibility split
- Human-controlled scheduling

Includes both:
- Laravel backend API
- Next.js frontend for interactive roster management

---

## Tech I’ve Been Using Recently

- **Backend:** Laravel, PHP
- **Frontend:** Next.js
- **Infra / Systems:** Redis (locks, queues, cache), OpenVPN
- **DevOps:** Docker, Docker Compose
- **Databases:** Relational (MySQL)

Thanks for stopping by!
